# Teachable Machine

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), is a tool from Google that allows image, sound and posture recognition right in the browser, all in minutes. This tool is handy for rapid prototyping, without the need to spend hours coding and training an image machine learning system.

The question I asked myself, "How do I use this tool in Unity?". 

As I did not find a solution to this atypical case, I propose a solution using the [WebSocket protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), as well as a complete demonstration of an implementation.

Have a good listening !
